            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Charlotte, NC, to two immigrant parents. Although I have lived here most of my life, I have also lived in other states. I lived in Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; and even a year in Mexico.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Currently working part-time in retail, hoping to land an internship soon.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m a second-year computer science major, concentrating in cybersecurity.</li>
                <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have never dabbled in web development, but after the first lecture, I’m interested in learning more! I do know the languages Python, Java, C, and assembly RISC-V.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> A Windows 11 home laptop and a Windows 11 PC.</li>
                <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ITIS 3135 Web-based Application Design and Development:</strong> I wanted to learn HTML and how to create my own websites.</li>
                        <li><strong>MATH 2164 Matrices & Linear Algebra:</strong> A required class, advisor told me to take this instead of Calculus 2 because the workload would’ve been too much.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITIS 2175 Logic and Algorithms:</strong> Required class but I’ve seen that it's good to take this class with matrices in the same semester.</li>
                        <li><strong>CJUS 2350 Intro to Corrections:</strong> I’m trying to get a minor in criminal justice and this seemed like an interesting 2000-level course.</li>
                        <li><strong>THEA 1512 Theatre/Film in the United States:</strong> A required general education class, and I heard it was an easy class.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Funny/Interesting item to remember me by:</strong> In my junior year of high school, I saved up for a PC and built it by myself, but I kept messing things up, so it took me about 2 weeks for it to run properly. I even got zapped by the power cord at one point.</li>
                <li><strong>I’d also like to share:</strong> I have a cat named Chopper that I love very much, named after the One Piece character although I’ve never watched One Piece.</li>
